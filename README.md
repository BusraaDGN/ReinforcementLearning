# Reinforcement Learning
								7ech-Agents Team
								
								
As "7ech-Agents", we used Deep Q-Learning, one of the Reinforcement Learning algorithms, in the Escape Game that we developed using Pygame. In this game, our white player moves up and down while trying to avoid the red enemies coming from the right of the screen, while trying to collect the yellow colored bonus boxes. The program we have developed trains itself according to the reward points earned by playing the game many times. It earns rewards or penalties based on the time he spends in the game, collides with enemies, and collects bonuses and updates himself accordingly.
